TODO find other tracks which look good more aphex

Slinky / MushroomCloud

A simple app which loads a track from Soundcloud via a node.js proxy and generates a 3d visualisation with webGL.

In essence it is these projects plumbed together:

Dancer.js
Three.js
AbientCloud https://github.com/oampo/AmbientCloud

And some others....

Copying and pasting any soundcloud track url should work to rebuild the visualiser without reloading.

Or try these:
