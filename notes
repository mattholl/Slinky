build mouse rotation around x axis and easing etc.
csg.js to create ring shape
create responders objects - create geometry and mesh/material within constructor - same way of looping thru update func?

1. stabilise using update function
	1. get the right frequencies
	2. make sure responders are removed
	3. get the rate of movement right - lower frequencies slower
2. use three.js - no need to even use 3d... just canvas?


use easing equations to accelerate radius towards the edges
limit mouse movement - easing also to view above and below

need to refactor to use update function rather than letting the animation loop drive
should be easy to let three.js handle the canvas drawing and cpu handle calculations

create Responder object
	each beat has a responder object
	create when beat on
	draw function increase radius and fill black
	when beat off (fnarr) fill with white - no need to construct shape cos it'll wipe out others
	needs to detect if it's off screen and delete


create a number of beat listeners at range of frequenceies
when a beat fires it's depth in space  -or from beat on until beat off
 - use polar coordinate system - radius contantly incresing through time
 	mock up a 2d version first


_____fluid ripples
incorporate this
https://github.com/corbanbrook/dsp.js/

to crate solid ripples over the interacting rings from differnet points
loci = frequencyies - mapped to 2d x = frequeency, y = amplitude / volume?
this plane can be move in 3d by the user, use mouse movement delta - touch interface
