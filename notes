set up stats on mttholl.com before emailing the library guy - tweeting etc.
	need to leave running for a while
	http://wiki.openwebanalytics.com/index.php?title=Installation
install node in server lab and snapshot from the control panel

build mouse rotation around x axis and easing etc.
		put dancer in a worker?
		spawn one worker per cylinder?
	use easing equations to accelerate radius towards the edges
	limit mouse movement - easing also to view above and below

set up beat pulsing rather than continuous rings
	remember easing again
	so scale factor needs to be increased and fall away to -ve val
	vary pulse rate and fallback rate to frequency ie. bas tones die away slower

pause stops music but not render loop
	means having an anim loop not tied to Dancer update callback

layered in y axis different colours

upload

this can make it more general, choose specific frequency ranges rather than tailoring to the track
intergrate with flash - integrate with soundcloud!

get files server side with node - process and send the data to the browser, web workers and Sockets
of course compare data sizes and transfer rates -automate

another version - instead of expanding the shape beyond the screen - just pulse it to the beat
decrement the scale continously over time / again easing, faster at first then slower
ramp up the scale on a beat (eased) - saves destroying and creating lots of objects......

so in a 2d canvas verions use overlapping different colors

need to refactor to use update function rather than letting the animation loop drive
should be easy to let three.js handle the canvas drawing and cpu handle calculations

create Responder object
	each beat has a responder object
	create when beat on
	draw function increase radius and fill black
	when beat off (fnarr) fill with white - no need to construct shape cos it'll wipe out others
	needs to detect if it's off screen and delete


create a number of beat listeners at range of frequenceies
when a beat fires it's depth in space  -or from beat on until beat off
 - use polar coordinate system - radius contantly incresing through time
 	mock up a 2d version first


_____fluid ripples
1. create flat doughnut torus
	

init funtion flow

create scene
create camera
add camera to scene

create geometry for shape
create material for the shape - texture?
create a mesh from the geometry and the material
add the mesh to the scene

create a renderer
add the renderer to the document

run animate loop - call render()
	change camera position - move mesh around
	tell the renderer to render the changes - the function render is called in the anim loop
	
incorporate this
https://github.com/corbanbrook/dsp.js/

to crate solid ripples over the interacting rings from differnet points
loci = frequencyies - mapped to 2d x = frequeency, y = amplitude / volume?
this plane can be move in 3d by the user, use mouse movement delta - touch interface

analysing visual layout of code - visual semantics - double space blocks, comment length and position
keep all dom calls in one file, keep all server interaction in another - set up filesysstem connections, use local file storage in the browser

deliver chunks of data - sections of the track, packets a 32 bit float array indexes 0 to 20,
cut copy deliver, store to send again if required, trigger an event to the browser -listner in the browser responds by getting ready to receive the data, setting up the required data structures
