black circles expanding outwards

notes
put together 

https://github.com/jsantell/dancer.js
and rings moving out

create a number of beat listeners at range of frequenceies
when a beat fires it's depth in space  -or from beat on until beat off
 - use polar coordinate system - radius contantly incresing through time
 	mock up a 2d version first


_____fluid ripples
incorporate this
https://github.com/corbanbrook/dsp.js/

to crate solid ripples over the interacting rings from differnet points
loci = frequencyies - mapped to 2d x = frequeency, y = amplitude / volume?
this plane can be move in 3d by the user, use mouse movement delta - touch interface
