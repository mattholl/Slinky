create Responder object
	each beat has a responder object
	create when beat on
	draw function increase radius and fill black
	when beat off (fnarr) fill with white - no need to construct shape cos it'll wipe out others
	needs to detect if it's off screen and delete


create a number of beat listeners at range of frequenceies
when a beat fires it's depth in space  -or from beat on until beat off
 - use polar coordinate system - radius contantly incresing through time
 	mock up a 2d version first


_____fluid ripples
incorporate this
https://github.com/corbanbrook/dsp.js/

to crate solid ripples over the interacting rings from differnet points
loci = frequencyies - mapped to 2d x = frequeency, y = amplitude / volume?
this plane can be move in 3d by the user, use mouse movement delta - touch interface
