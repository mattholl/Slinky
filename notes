put self organising voronoi online - 
	title: Self-organising Vornoi Cells - email andy re. grammar
	desc: An animation which branched from playing with toxiclibs.js for the Voronoi animations below. A balance of the minumum distance required between the points and thir repulsion from one another, varying the number of points produces different tesselations - dat.gui?? to allow user to vary the number of points - call setup on change of this value - jQuery stle slider and massive numebers. 

if can't connect to soundcloud offer a choice of local oggs - email the artists?
	email to dancer author to see if he'll help?

if soundcloud doesn't work just use clayhill dub - get email through warp? replex records?

when dancer stops updating call pause?or stop?
email this is my jam - i was inspired by using the soundcloud api to stream a track -

tidy
add details - links etc.
upload w. basic auth

work on my website - responsive stuff

get ppl to test

email spaces
email dancer author

this can make it more general, choose specific frequency ranges rather than tailoring to the track
intergrate with flash - integrate with soundcloud!

pull in comments?

node.js
	deliver chunks of data - sections of the track, packets a 32 bit float array indexes 0 to 20,
	cut copy deliver, store to send again if required, trigger an event to the browser -listner in the browser responds by getting ready to receive the data, setting up the required data structures

get files server side with node - process and send the data to the browser, web workers and Sockets
of course compare data sizes and transfer rates -automate

	init funtion flow

	create scene
	create camera
	add camera to scene

	create geometry for shape
	create material for the shape - texture?
	create a mesh from the geometry and the material
	add the mesh to the scene

	create a renderer
	add the renderer to the document

	run animate loop - call render()
		change camera position - move mesh around
		tell the renderer to render the changes - the function render is called in the anim loop

_____fluid ripples
1. create flat doughnut torus

to crate solid ripples over the interacting rings from differnet points
loci = frequencyies - mapped to 2d x = frequeency, y = amplitude / volume?
this plane can be move in 3d by the user, use mouse movement delta - touch interface

----------
analysing visual layout of code - visual semantics - double space blocks, comment length and position
keep all dom calls in one file, keep all server interaction in another - set up filesysstem connections, use local file storage in the browser
